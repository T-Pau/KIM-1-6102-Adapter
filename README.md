# KIM-1 6102 RAM Adapter

**Warning: I have not tested this design yet.**

The MOS KIM-1 uses eight 6102 1x1k SRAM ICs. These are hard to find and expensive, so I made this adapter to replace them with one 62256 8x32k SRAM IC. 

It was designed to fit the [KIM-1 Replica](https://github.com/eduardocasino/kim-1) by Eduardo Casino. It has no solder mask on the front to match its appearance.

You can either mount it directly to the main board, or you can mount sockets and put the adapter in those. If you use sockets, use pin headers with round âŒ€0.5mm pins.

## Bill of Materials
